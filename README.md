# ZEUS Project

## Project Status: On Hold

Development of ZEUS is currently paused due to recent developments in Matter and the Thread-Protocol
It will be continued once the Smart-Home Market finds its specifications.

## Setup

The "startup.py" file triggers the setups of the current extensions.

## What ZEUS is about

This project is designed to make smart home unified and offer more fluid control over it from a Python perspective.
It will advance towards a maintainable API where all the displays in a smart home can refer to. It should also support data logging of sensor data from every smart home device, thus making it usable for a data analysis or smart home automation predictions.

Currently configured for:
- Spotify API
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Philips Hue Devices
- Tuya Devices
