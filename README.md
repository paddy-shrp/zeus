# ZEUS Project

This project is designed to make smart home unified and have more fluid control over it from a python perspective.
It will advance towards a maintainable API where all the displays in a smart home can refer to.

Currently configured for:
- Philips Hue Devices
- Tuya Devices
- Spotify API

## Setup

Running the "startup.py" file triggers the setups of the current extensions.

## Project Status: On Hold

Development of ZEUS is currently paused due to recent developments of Matter and the Thread-Protcoll
It will be continued once the Smart-Home Market finds it's specifications. 

However due to more experience in coding and project management it is verly likely that this whole project will be rewritten as __it is not__ presentable at it's current state as it is from 2022.
